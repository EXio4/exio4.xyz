Hello! My name is Esteban Ruiz Moreno, although I often use **exio4** as a nickname.

I'm currently a university student, and a programmer (although you might you know that already if you are here!)

I'm mostly starting this blog to have a place to rant about weird things, or to talk about random things I like, care, or don't care about, or well, whatever that comes to my mind.

My biggest hobbies are all related to programming in one way to another, so it shouldn't be surprising to see programming in most, if not all, the things I post here, I guess :)

You can find my resume [here](/pages/resume/)
